# Ollama UI to Code Streamlit App

Forked from https://github.com/Doriandarko/gemini-ui-to-code

This Streamlit app is designed to convert UI designs into code using the power of AI. It analyzes uploaded images of UI designs and generates corresponding HTML code, making it easier for developers to bring their designs to life.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration

You can also select the Ollama model you want and even tell the model to use a specific CSS framework. I recommend using the codestral 22B parameter model.
